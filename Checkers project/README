# Project Description

The objective of this project is to build an application that allows two players to play a simplified version of the well-known game of Checkers. The simplifications include:

- Each turn consists of only one move or capture.
- When a piece reaches the last row, the game ends, and that player wins.
- Capturing is not mandatory.

The project involves constructing a set of classes that implement this simplified version of the game. The system will display the board, allow valid piece selection, and indicate if the game has ended.

# Key Features

- Display the game board.
- Allow selection of valid pieces and moves.
- Indicate game termination.
